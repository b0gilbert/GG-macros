Download as a zipped folder and unzip.

Two folders will appear, called “Put in Igor Procedures” and “Put in User Procedures”. 

Please locate the folder on your computer called 
… User/Documents/Wavemetrics/Igor Pro (v) User Files/
where v is the Igor version 

The contents of “Put in Igor Procedures” should be transferred to Igor Procedures, e.g.
Macintosh HD/Users/Pupa/Documents/Wavemetrics/Igor Pro 8 User Files/Igor Procedures

The contents of “Put in User Procedures” should be transferred to User Procedures, e.g.
Macintosh HD/Users/Pupa/Documents/Wavemetrics/Igor Pro 8 User Files/User Procedures

Mac users: the files should not be placed in Applications/IgorPro/… 
PC users: the files should not be placed in Program Files/Wavemetrics/IgorPro/… 

Restart Igor, and you are done.

Now you are ready to play. We hope you enjoy using this software as much as we do.

Updating the macros:
The macros in the User Procedures folder are updated frequently. To update, simply replace these files. The “INCLUDES_xx” files in the Igor Procedures do not need updating.
